## Making pretty generated SVGs in Python

I am giving a talk at PyconAU 2019 showng how to build SVG and using generative art as a motivator. 

This is where I'm puytting all my code so people can have a look, have a play and maybe even give advice (particularly on dumb if statements when I should be using clever maths).

Everything is available to steal and play with . **Please share alike**.
